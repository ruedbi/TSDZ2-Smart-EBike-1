OSF Parameter settings for Dummies - notes from a Newbie

The parameter setting concept is confusing at first.
Things to mention:
- The setting is done by hijacking the "lights" key.
- The key works one-way only, from the display to the controller, and after initiating the settings mode by switching on, the controller only cares for status changes.
- Any setting is binary, and most of the time it is a toggle: disable to enable of vice versa; so there is e.g. no adjustment of a speed limit from 25 to 30 or something.
- Do not get confused if the display reacts with dimming on the lights-key action (depends on the display and the setting), especially that "lights on" means "display dim", rather understand it as a action confirmation.

How it works (concept idea)
turn the light on to get into the configurator
if you really intended to only use the light, just do nothing till the action times out (5s by default)
- during this time the first setting is shown, along with the first error-code
- if you want to change this setting or want to proceed to the next setting, press the lights key again (light state toggles) before the timeout
- the new state is shown, blinking
- to accept the new setting, let it time out
- to go to the next setting, toggle the light before the timeout
this procedure gets repeated for the 2nd and 3rd setting


If you compile the code yourself, I recommend these settings until you are familiar with it:
advanced - time to menu items: 100 - this gives you more time (10s) to react before the controller times out (see below); can be larger than 60 as indicated in the tool
advanced - number of data displayed at lights on: 1
advanced - data 1: 1
advanced - time to displayed data 1: 10
the latter 3 settings make the battery level appear for 1s, when configuration exits; so when you see e.g. 99 (%) when battery is full, you know you are no longer in config mode
